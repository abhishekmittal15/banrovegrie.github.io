### Don't criticize what you can't understand

Don't write what you do not — to at least a certain admissible level —  understand. This reminds me of the line in Bob Dylan's song "don't criticize what you can't understand". $1+0$

### My ideas from a dialogue between Bob Tarjan and Don Knuth

Well one thing that absolutely blew my mind was Knuth talking about Computer Science from the broad perspective of being a mathematician and scientist. It started with this question posed by Tarjan — Do you (Knuth) consider yourself as a mathematician, a scientist, an engineer a philosopher or an artist?

Knuth gave a very fine answer. He said that he believes science is that which is so well understood by us humans that we can code it up into a computer. However, very often we find our mind meanders around and stays a few jumps ahead which ultimately depicts itself as art.

He also exclaimed how mathematics and computer science are the only domains that exist in the realm on science yet are not directly based of nature and rather belong to worlds designed artificially by us (plug-in computational thinking vs mathematical thinking).

### On what engineering means

Zeeshan mentioned the meaning of the word "engineering" means "cleverness".

### Universe is a Search Problem?

Purpose of the universe: is the universe just another parallel process in some kind of interacting parallel processes working on a search problem?

### Measure Shoudn't be a target

Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes.

In other words, "when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure." Isn't it exactly what happened in MDL Project?

### On recent non-fiction books I love

I fucking love Scott Aaronson's book. Quantum Computing since Democritus falls in my Birth of a Theorem category. I absolutely love them.

Feynman's two autobiographical books, especially "What do you care what other people think" is a amazing motivator.

I guess I will talk about old reads which changed my perspective, sometime later.

A little off-topic but Lex Fridman's podcast has severely affected my life — in a very good way.

### Richard Borcherds interview

Try counter-examples and try proving at the same time, for sure either one will work out.

Mathematics is discovered. How? If there were another civilization that we come across, we shall share the same mathematical ideas — even though representations and formalisms might be different. Now my question is that — does it mean humans can serve to be "universal conscious machine" because they can do math?

There are some mathematicians whose work I could have never discovered for myself — no matter how harder or smarter I worked — Grothendieck is one of them.

### On Technology

I want to be a Computer Scientist and an Engineer — not just because of my interest but also because I want to fight evil regimes and technology (not just mere ideas) is the greatest weapon against authoritarianism.

### On Fiction and Literature

Good literature helps you build your soul. Literature drives us through the ideas and problems a person is facing by standing on his or her foorsteps and thinking about choices and their effects — choices that you or I may never face directly but does help in thinking clearly about a ton of other choices that we shall come across in life.

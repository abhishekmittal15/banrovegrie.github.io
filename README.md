### Focus on Understanding, Problem Solving and Creating for that is how you exactly get things done.

```latex
This is a strategy of getting things during Research/Study in general.

1. Don't focus too much in organisation, and certainly donot overindulge yourself in it. 
(K.I.S.S.)
2. On learning a new idea/trick/topic, make more connections in order to retain.
(Connecting the Dots) 

After all data gets scattered, information is lost, what is known is forgotten but wisdom remains.
